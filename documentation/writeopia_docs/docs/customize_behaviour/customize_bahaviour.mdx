# Customize Behaviour

The base class for behaviour controlling in Writeopia is [WriteopiaManager](https://kdocs.writeopia.io/writeopia/io.writeopia.sdk.manager/-writeopia-manager/index.html) and this is the entry point for all logic customization, with some exceptions. 

In this section you will learn the default behaviour of Writeopia and how to customize it to fit your needs.

## Swipe to edit
One way to edit messages, checkbox, images, etc, is to to horizontally swipe to select the content.

This behaviour is provided by the default implementations [StoryStepDrawer](https://kdocs.writeopia.io/writeopia/io.writeopia.sdk.drawer/-story-step-drawer/index.html). To provide this behavior to a custom drawer, use [SwipeBox](https://kdocs.writeopia.io/writeopia/io.writeopia.sdk.uicomponents/-swipe-box.html) in your drawers.
