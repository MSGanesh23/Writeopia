# Export Markdown

![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.leandroborgesferreira/writeopia-export)

Writeopia comes with a plugin to allow exporting information in some formats, like Markdown. You can add the `export` library.

```kotlin
```kotlin
// This will change to implementation("io.writeopia:writeopia-export:[version]") in next version
implementation("com.github.leandroborgesferreira:writeopia-export:[version]")
```
```

You can export a document to markdown with the following code: 

```kotlin
private fun documentToMd(document: Document): String =
    DocumentToMarkdown.parse(document.content)
```
