# StoryTeller - WIP

An SDK to create a editor for stories. 

You can use this library to create a better story edition withing apps. Apps for social media (posts), travel logs, blog apps (like Medium), chats (like Slack) can use the library to provide a great experience when editing text with media. 

Instead of posting all picture, videos, audios or any other media in one position of the app and add a `EditText` this library allows to put media and text together in a story line. Example of app created with the SDK:
